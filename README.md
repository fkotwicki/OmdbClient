Small project that demonstrates usage of the most popular (and in my opinion - the best) libraries in Android developers community, such as:

- RxJava
- Retrofit
- Dagger 2.0
- ButterKnife
- Otto
- Picasso

The application allows to find a movie and display its details. It uses OMDb API (http://www.omdbapi.com/).
